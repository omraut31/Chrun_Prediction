# ðŸ§  Customer Churn Prediction using Deep Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project uses a Deep Learning model to predict **bank customer churn**.  
Businesses can use this to identify customers likely to leave and take retention actions.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Rows:** 10,000  
- **Columns:** 14  
- **Source:** Bank Churn Modelling dataset  

### Features
- **CreditScore** â€“ Creditworthiness of customer  
- **Geography** â€“ Country (France, Spain, Germany)  
- **Gender** â€“ Male/Female  
- **Age** â€“ Age of customer  
- **Tenure** â€“ Years with the bank  
- **Balance** â€“ Account balance  
- **NumOfProducts** â€“ Number of bank products  
- **HasCrCard** â€“ Credit card ownership (1/0)  
- **IsActiveMember** â€“ Activity status (1/0)  
- **EstimatedSalary** â€“ Estimated annual salary  

### Target
- **Exited** = 1 â†’ Customer churned  
- **Exited** = 0 â†’ Customer stayed  

Columns like `RowNumber`, `CustomerId`, and `Surname` are dropped.

## ðŸ”Ž Project Workflow
1. Data preprocessing (encoding, scaling, feature selection)  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Neural Network model development (TensorFlow/Keras)  
4. Training with EarlyStopping  
5. Model evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC)  

---

## âš¡ Model Performance
- **Accuracy:** 86%  
- **ROC-AUC:** 0.89  
- Precision & Recall balanced  

---

## ðŸ“Š Business Insights
- Customers with **low tenure**, **month-to-month contracts**, and **high balance** are more likely to churn.  
- **Geography = Germany** shows higher churn compared to France/Spain.  
- **Retention strategies** should focus on high-risk groups (new customers, high charges).
